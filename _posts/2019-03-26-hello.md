#Few words about me
My name is Alex, I live in Montreal and I'm passionnate about DataScience topics and Mobile app developpement. This blog aims to present some of my projects and talk about what I have learned during my exploration of the world of data science.

I'm not a native English speaker so it will also help me practice my English writing skill :)

#DataScience

I first started with courses on udacity and pluralsight on machine learning topics. It was just to understand the basic concepts and what can we do with them.

I was really surprise by the concepts and wanted to know more about them so I decided to take it further. The first new course was the DataScientist track on DataCamp (https://www.datacamp.com/profile/alexpoulain). It was really good to practice some python and discover all the main library like Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Bokeh, scipy, keras and spacy.

It gave me the motivation to push on these topics.

Then I took Andrew N.G incredible course on coursera. It's a really good one (https://fr.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), it helped me tackle the theory behind all these.

After that, all I wanted to do was experiment. That's when I started Jeremy Howard Fast.ai courses on Deep Learning and it was an absolute blast (https://www.fast.ai/).

There are 2 parts for the deep learning course and for the moment, I haven't started the second part yet.

This blog will help me to practice some of the concepts explained during the course and make sure I have understood them correctly. I find the process of writing about something really useful, it makes me question things more and it force me to try things!

Let's give it a try!
