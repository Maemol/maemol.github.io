## Few words about me

My name is Alex, I live in Montreal and I'm passionnate about DataScience topics and Mobile app developpement. This blog aims to present some of my projects and talk about what I have learned during my exploration of the world of data science.

I'm not a native English speaker so it will also help me practice my English writing skill :)

## DataScience

I first started with courses on udacity and pluralsight on machine learning topics. It was just to understand the basic concepts and what can we do with them.

I was really surprise by the concepts and wanted to know more about them so I decided to take it further. The first new course was the DataScientist track on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/alexpoulain). It was really good to practice some python and discover all the main library like :
 
| Library | Url |
| :------ |:--- |
| Pandas | [https://pandas.pydata.org/](https://pandas.pydata.org/) |
| matplotlib | [https://matplotlib.org/](https://matplotlib.org/) |
| Bokeh | [https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) |
| Scikit-Learn | [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) |
| SciPy | [https://www.scipy.org/](https://www.scipy.org/) |
| Keras | [https://keras.io/](https://keras.io/) |
| spaCy | [https://spacy.io/](https://spacy.io/) |

It gave me the motivation to push on these topics.

Then I took Andrew N.G incredible course on [coursera](https://fr.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). It's a really good one, it helped me tackle the theory behind all these.

After that, all I wanted to do was experiment. That's when I started Jeremy Howard [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) courses on Deep Learning and it was an absolute blast.

There are 2 parts for the deep learning course and for the moment, I haven't started the second part yet.

Fast.ai is based on pytorch but I try to practice with Tensorflow also.

You can see it as a couple of Low level API + High level API : 

| Library | Url |
| :------ |:--- |
| Tensorflow + Keras | [https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://www.tensorflow.org/) | [https://keras.io/](https://keras.io/) |
| PyTorch + Fastai | [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/) | [https://docs.fast.ai/](https://docs.fast.ai/) |

This blog will help me to practice some of the concepts explained during the course and make sure I have understood them correctly. I find the process of writing about something really useful, it makes me question things more and it force me to try things!

Let's give it a try!
