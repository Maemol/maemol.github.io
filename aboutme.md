My name is Alex, I live in Montreal and Iâ€™m passionnate about DataScience topics and Mobile app developpement. This blog aims to present some of my projects and talk about what I have learned during my exploration of the world of data science.

I work in Finance as a Business Analyst BI, I manage marketdata acquisition and transformation for OTC pricing.

I really enjoy diving into a bunch of data, I find it to be very rewarding when something emerged ;)
